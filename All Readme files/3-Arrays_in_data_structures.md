# Arrays in Data Structure

- arrays are the collection of a finite number of homogeneous data elements.
- elements of the array are referred repectively by an index set consisting of n consecutive numbers and are stored repectively in successive memory locations.
- the array elements can be accessed in a constant time by using the index of the particular element.(size grow ya shrink nahi kar sakte).
- arrays ka yeh ek fayda hai ki hum ise fast access kar sakte hai.

## Arrays Dimensions

- **1D array**: a list of data items that can be represented by one variable name using only one subscript and such variable is called one dimensional array.
- **2D array**: a list of data items that can be conceptualize as rows and columns, which can be represented using one name and two subscripts.

- dimension kuch bhi ho data lagatar hi consume hoga(continuous hi hoga consumption).Farak hai indexing me bas
