# Introduction to Data Structures

- variables names are the placeholderfor representing the data.

## Data Types

- A data type in a programming language is a set of data with the values having predefined charactersitics.
- System/compiler defined data type are called **primitive data type**.
- Structure in C/CPP and classes in CPP/Java are the means to create our own data type known as **user defined data type**.

## Data Structure

- data structure is a particular way of storing and organizing data in a computer so that it can be used efficiently.

## Classification

- two major classification of data structure are there:
  - Linear data structure(link list , stack , queue)
  - non linear data structure(tree, graph)

## Abstract Data Type

- All primitive data types supports basic operations like addition, subtraction, etc.
- the system is providing the implementation for the primitive data types.
- for non primitive data types we also need to define operations.
- Combination of data structure and their opertion are known as **Abstract Data Type**.
- so data structure is all about creating abstract data type.
- any piece of information can be handled by definig appropriate data type and set of possible operations.
